# Update v2.0.0
- Consolidated the JS for the pages.
- Added single cards you can link to and get the info.
- Added loading page.
- YOU DO NOT NEED TO UPDATE THE INDEX FILE! Just the JS and CSS.
> All updates have been tested in major browsers, but I can't guarantee they'll work in lesser known browsers.
